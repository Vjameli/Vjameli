#### What you can find here :mag_right:

On GitHub, I provide the scripts from my college's projects and the ones from my research.

#### Research :microscope:

My research field is radiotherapy planning, but my interest lies in optimization methods used in the planning process, including: 
linear and non-linear programming, numerical analysis, and stochastic methods.

Quoted from Sebastiaan Breedveld: *"It is my ambition to greatly improve radiation therapy treatment, providing the highest quality treatment possible, for each individual patient."*
