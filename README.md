### Hi there 👋

I'm a 21 years old Brazilian researcher, finishing my major in applied mathematics.

#### What you can find here

On GitHub, I provide the scripts from my college's projects and the ones from my research.

#### Research: 

My research field is radiotherapy planning, but my interest lies in optimization methods used in the planning process, including: 
linear and non-linear programming, numerical analysis, and stochastics methods.

Quoted from Sebastiaan Breedveld: 

*"It is my ambition to greatly improve radiation therapy treatment, providing the highest quality treatment possible, for each individual patient."*
